                    <p class="TextLarge">CCA (Creative Collaboration Association) is an officially recognized club of The Village School.</p>
                    <p>In the club, each member can create an activity that the club members can do as a whole. They can share it among the members 
                        and listen to their comments and suggestions. Then, we will do that proposed activity as a club.
                        The purpose of the club is for the members to get out of their 'comfort zones' and socialize with various students from around the world.<br/>
