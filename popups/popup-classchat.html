                ClassChat is an open-invitation online chat service that allows 
                anyone to seamlessly communicate with anyone in their school.
                <br/><br/>
                The COVID-19 pandemic forced schools worldwide to online remote
                learning, but this is causing some problems in students. Many
                are unable to ask classmates questions, find tutoring support,
                or make new friends. It's also not just during the COVID-19 pandemic;
                the lack of communication between students has been a chronic issue.
                <br/><br/>
                ClassChat allows anyone to seamlessly join any group chat within 
                their school. It allows better connection among the students, 
                provides easy access to support, and bridges the gap between students.

                This project was developed as a team for the WWPHacks2020 hackathon
                within the 24-hour time limit.
                I worked as a full-stack developer, designing the entire frontend visual components
                as well as writing most of the functioning Java Servlets for the backend.
                I was also the one who came up with the idea.
                <br/><br/>
                The project got into the <b>Top 15</b> out of approximately
                270 participants from around the world!
